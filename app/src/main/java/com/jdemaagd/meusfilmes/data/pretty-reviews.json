         "content":"Admittedly, Yeon Sang-ho's enthusiasm is infectious and, while 'Peninsula' is never as exciting as its source materials, it is kind of fun in an agreeably dumb, unpretentious way. But if Sang-ho wants people to keep stealing from him, he's going to have to stop stealing so blatantly from others.\r\n- Jake Watt\r\n\r\nRead Jake's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-peninsula-an-action-packed-but-brainless-follow-up-to-a-horror-classic",

         "content":"**Summary**  \r\nI had decently high hopes for this, given it is my favorite genre and Train to Busan was pretty good. However, this was a major disappointment.\r\n\r\n**The good**  \r\nThe plot, set four years in the future from Train to Busan and decent build-up with ok back story to most things going on. General atmosphere is also nice.\r\n\r\n**The bad**  \r\nGiant plot holes, some so large and obvious it is almost impossible to enjoy the movie.\r\n\r\nVehicle CGI, especially the physics. It is so bad my dead dog would make it better. To make matters worse these scenes make up for an unreasonably large portion of the movie. I got seriously angry watching it, and I love zombies and car chases.\r\n\r\nThe violently over dramatic ending. This is comedy level shit, even if the rest of the movie was good, this would have destroyed it.",
